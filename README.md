# PythonApp
So this is my test to try communicate between a built website and a MySQL database on my local machine. 
I am using Python flask modules to accomplish this and I'm adapting it from an online source.

The main program is a Python code named 'app.py' which opens up a link to the website (html pages).
It is still heavily under development and I'm currently working on code more suited to the OAD needs:

    - potential project leaders submit their proposals online
    - the public can query the database via keywords (PI, project, region, taskforce, year etc)
This should streamline project management once sufficiently developed.
